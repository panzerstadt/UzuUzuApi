start the server
- double click run_uui_server.bat
# alternatively, run uui_server.py from command line (python3 uui_server.py)

wait for the server to load (tensorflow takes time)

open a webpage (tested on chrome, but should work on anything)

perform a GET request
- parameters taken: uui (12 features) and outdoor preference (1 feature)
- all features are required, otherwise it throws an error (might be a silent error)
e.g. - http://localhost:8080/?uui=Thu,5,20.8,1,56,0,1.96,30.6,10,2,0.087407407,0.355&outdoor=0.9
